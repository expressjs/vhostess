# Virtual Hostess [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/vhostess.png)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/vhostess)

Virtual host sub-domain mapping. This is semi-extracted from [connect.vhost()](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/vhost.html).

This is different than connect's `vhost` as it sits between the HTTP server and any "apps" instead of being used within an app.

## Example

```js
var koaApp = require('koa')()
var expressApp = require('express')()
var connectApp = require('connect')()

var hostess = require('vhostess')()

http.createServer(hostess).listen(3000)

hostess.use('koa.app.com', koaApp.callback())
hostess.use('express.app.com', expressApp)
hostess.use('connect.app.com', connectApp)
hostess.use(function (req, res) {
  res.statusCode = 404
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')
  res.end('subdomain needed')
})
```

## API

### var hostess = Hostess()

```js
var hostess = require('vhostess')()
http.createServer(hostess).listen()
```

Returns a `(req, res)` function to be passed to `http.createServer()` or to `app.use()` in Connect/Express.

### hostess.use(hostname, fn)

`hostname` such as `example.com`, `*.example.com`, etc. `fn` is a callback function with the signature `(req, res)`.

Notes:

- `next` is __not__ supported.
- Mounting HTTP servers is __not__ supported either.
- Order matters.

### hostess.use(fn)

Default callback. You __must__ supply one, otherwise the server will throw.
